 

Problem Statement:

Implemented a Cricket number Game.
It can be played by 2 players.
Player 1 is going to start the game, have 3 wickets and 2 overs to play
(overs and wickets can be changed as per the requirement)

While playing the game we can check the score.
Used the logic of random number generator to score runs and built the logic of cricket game around it.

There are 2 innings played and whichever team score more runs WINS the match.

Modifications can be done, can have wide ball, NO ball, or individual player score.

In this code we have just implemented the basic functionality of a Cricket Game.
